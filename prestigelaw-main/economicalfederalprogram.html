            The Express Entry immigration program is a federal streamline comprised of a three-stage process as follows:
            <br>

            1. Applicants submit an online Express Entry form to express their interest in migrating to Canada. <br>
            2. IRCC assesses the potential applicants against specific eligibility criteria. If eligible, applicants are
            entered into a pool of eligible candidates. <br>
            3. Candidates whose profiles align with the identified needs of the government will be issued an “Invitation
            To Apply” (ITA).
            <p><br></p>
            Only those candidates who receive invitations can then proceed to apply for permanent residency. 
            <br>
            There are three immigration programs managed through Express Entry Streamline: <br>

            1. Canadian Experience Class <br>
            2. Federal Skilled Worker Program <br>
            3. Federal Skilled Trades Program <br>
            <p><br></p>
            If you’re eligible for one of the above programs, you can also apply through Express Entry for the
            Provincial Nominee Program (PNP). If you’re nominated, you’ll get extra points so you can be invited to
            apply quickly.
            <p><br></p>
            Immigration process can be cumbersome, time consuming and need at most care and attention when applying. An
            expert with full knowledge and experience can save you through the hassle. Do not wait, contact us today to
            find out if you are eligible.
